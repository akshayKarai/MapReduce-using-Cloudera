Files used in this assignment
1. DocWordCount.java
2. TermFrequency.java
3. TFIDF.java
4. Search.java
5. Cantrbry file.

All files were placed in Assignment2 folder in Clodera's home




**************Execution of DocWordCount************




1) Created a directory for assignment2 using the following command
	$ hadoop fs -mkdir /user/cloudera/assignment2/
2) Created a directory for input files directories
    	$ hadoop fs -mkdir /user/cloudera/assignment2/input

3) Add all the 8 input files to the directory created in the previous step.
	$ hadoop fs -put cantrbry/* /user/cloudera/assignment2/input

4) Compiled the DocWordCount.java file  and create a jar using the below commands

	$ mkdir -p build
	$ javac -cp /usr/lib/hadoop/*:/usr/lib/hadoop-mapreduce/* DocWordCount.java -d build -Xlint 
	$ jar -cvf docWordCount.jar -C build/ .

5) Used the following command to run the docWordCount.jar on the input files and calculate the document word count.
	$ hadoop jar docWordCount.jar org.myorg.DocWordCount /user/cloudera/assignment2/input /user/cloudera/assignment2/docwordcount/output

6) Output generated by the DocWordCount can be accessed using the following commands.

********** To copy output to local: **********

	$ hadoop fs -cat /user/cloudera/assignment2/docwordcount/output/*

********** To copy output to local: **********

	$ hadoop fs -copyToLocal /user/cloudera/assignment2/docwordcount/output/* .





**************Execution of TermFrequency **************




1) Compiled the TermFrequency file  and create a jar using the below commands
	
	$ javac -cp /usr/lib/hadoop/*:/usr/lib/hadoop-mapreduce/* TermFrequency.java -d build -Xlint

	$ jar -cvf termFrequency.jar -C build/ .

2) Used the following command to run the termFrequency.jar on the input files to calculate the Term Frequency.

	$ hadoop jar termFrequency.jar org.myorg.TermFrequency /user/cloudera/assignment2/input /user/cloudera/assignment2/termfrequency/output

3) Output generated by the TermFrequency can be accessed using the following commands.

********** To copy output to local: **********

	$ hadoop fs -cat /user/cloudera/assignment2/termfrequency/output/*

********** To copy output to local: **********

	$ hadoop fs -copyToLocal /user/cloudera/assignment2/termfrequency/output/* .





************** Execution of TFIDF **************




1) Compiled the TFIDF file  and create a jar using the below commands
	
	$ javac -cp /usr/lib/hadoop/*:/usr/lib/hadoop-mapreduce/* TFIDF.java -d build -Xlint

	$ jar -cvf tfidf.jar -C build/ .

2) Used the following command to run the tfidf.jar on the input files.

	$ hadoop jar tfidf.jar org.myorg.TFIDF /user/cloudera/assignment2/input /user/cloudera/assignment2/tfidf/output

3) Output generated by the TFIDF file can be accessed using the following commands.

**************	To read the output: **************
	$ hadoop fs -cat /user/cloudera/assignment2/tfidf/output/final/*
	
********** To copy output to local: **********
	$ hadoop fs -copyToLocal /user/cloudera/assignment2/tfidf/output/final/* .





**************Execution Instructions for Search **************





1) Compiled the search file  and created a jar using the commands mentioned below:s
	
	$ javac -cp /usr/lib/hadoop/*:/usr/lib/hadoop-mapreduce/* Search.java -d build -Xlint

	$ jar -cvf search.jar -C build/ .

2) Used the following command to run the search.jar on the input of the TFIDF.

	First query
	$ hadoop jar search.jar org.myorg.Search /user/cloudera/assignment2/tfidf/output/final /user/cloudera/assignment2/search/output computer science
	
	Second query
	$ hadoop jar search.jar org.myorg.Search /user/cloudera/assignment2/tfidf/output/final /user/cloudera/assignment2/search/output data analysis

3) Output generated by the Search file can be accessed using the following commands.

**************	To read the output: **************

	$ hadoop fs -cat /user/cloudera/assignment2/search/output/*


********** To copy output to local: **********

	$ hadoop fs -copyToLocal /user/cloudera/assignment2/search/output/* .
